# Inspector Panel Separation Fix

## Problem Solved
The demo mode was interfering with the real inspector functionality because both were using the same `InspectorPanel.current` instance. This caused:
- Real inspector timer not working when demo mode was active
- Export and clear buttons not functioning in real inspector
- Demo data contaminating real inspector sessions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separate Static Instances
```typescript
export class InspectorPanel {
  public static current: InspectorPanel | undefined;        // Real inspector
  public static demoInstance: InspectorPanel | undefined;   // Demo inspector
  private isDemoMode: boolean = false;                      // Instance flag
}
```

### 2. Separate Creation Logic
- `InspectorPanel.create(false)` â†’ Creates real inspector (default)
- `InspectorPanel.create(true)` â†’ Creates demo inspector with "DEMO MODE" title
- Each instance manages its own lifecycle independently

### 3. Telemetry Routing
```typescript
public static getInstanceForTelemetry(isDemoData: boolean): InspectorPanel | undefined {
  if (isDemoData) {
    return InspectorPanel.demoInstance;
  } else {
    return InspectorPanel.current;
  }
}
```

### 4. Data Isolation
```typescript
public receiveTelemetry(userId: string, type: string, payload: any, ts: number, displayName?: string) {
  // Only accept real telemetry if this is not demo mode, and only demo telemetry if this is demo mode
  const isDemoData = userId && userId.startsWith('DEMO_');
  if (this.isDemoMode !== isDemoData) {
    return; // Don't mix demo and real data
  }
  // ... rest of telemetry processing
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Real Inspector Mode
1. Created via "Manager: Start Inspector" command
2. Uses `InspectorPanel.current` static instance
3. Only receives real user telemetry (non-DEMO_ prefixed)
4. Timer, export, and clear functions work independently
5. Shows "Inspector Dashboard" title

### Demo Inspector Mode  
1. Created via "Manager: Test Inspector (Demo Mode)" command
2. Uses `InspectorPanel.demoInstance` static instance
3. Only receives demo telemetry (DEMO_ prefixed user IDs)
4. Has its own timer, export, and clear functions
5. Shows "Inspector Dashboard (DEMO MODE)" title
6. Generates fake student activity for testing

### Complete Separation
- Both can run simultaneously without interference
- Each has its own timer starting from panel creation
- Each has independent export functionality
- Demo exports are clearly marked with "ðŸ§ª DEMO MODE REPORT"
- Real exports work normally for actual monitoring sessions

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Real Inspector:**
   - Run "Manager: Start Inspector" 
   - Timer should start counting immediately
   - Export and clear buttons should work
   - No demo indicators should appear

2. **Test Demo Inspector:**
   - Run "Manager: Test Inspector (Demo Mode)"
   - Should show demo warning and orange "ðŸ§ª DEMO MODE" indicator
   - Timer should start and fake students should appear
   - Export should create demo-marked files
   - Clear should work for demo data only

3. **Test Both Together:**
   - Open both real and demo inspector panels
   - Each should maintain independent state
   - Real inspector won't show demo students
   - Demo inspector won't show real activity

## Result
âœ… Real inspector timer works independently  
âœ… Real inspector export/clear functions work  
âœ… Demo mode doesn't affect real functionality  
âœ… Both can run simultaneously for testing  
âœ… Complete data separation between demo and real sessions
