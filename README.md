**CONAINT** is a comprehensive VS Code extension for academic integrity monitoring and real-time code analysis. Perfect for educators, institutions, and development teams who need to monitor coding activities and detect potential academic misconduct.

## Features
As you can see from the discription that is what it does, if a user like open any desktop application when the inspection mode is one it will inform the inspector.

Anyone that have the extension can submit a problem he/she encounter while and any one can see it in the Feed mode it is like a mini stackoverflow.

There is also an AI integrated to my Conaint extention to help the inspector to translate the bunch of json.

I also add a timer to let the inspector and the student to now the amount time they are being inspect.

> Tip: Although i have not come accros any extension that solve this problem but most intresting part of my extention is the AI integrated to it, it has the abilty for it to translate the Json file that is expoorted from the inspector session to normal word so that anyone can understand it.

## Known Issues
Everything i use in creating this app is free so i do not the amount of user it can accumulate at once.
